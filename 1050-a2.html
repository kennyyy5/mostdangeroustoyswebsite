            <h3 style="font-size: 50px;"> AUSTIN MAGIC PISTOL </h3>   
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Austin Magic Pistol, also known as the Ping Pong Blaster, was a “toy gun” that also allowed for potential violence. The Magic Pistol utilized calcium carbide, a chemical that when combined with water created an explosive reaction. This reaction propelled ping pong balls out of the muzzle at a  very high speed.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Acetylene gas used to create the explosion was also extremely flammable. During use, a large number of these firearms either burst and broke or just detonated.  Certain American states have now categorized The Austin Magic Pistol as a legitimate firearm. Fortunately, due to safety concerns surrounding the fireball generated by this toy, it was swiftly removed from the market.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 45px;"> GILBERT CHEMISTRY SETS </h3>   
            <img src="chemistry19.jpg" alt="picture of gilert chemistry set" style="height: 50%; width:45%; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 335px;  margin-right: 335px; "  >
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Beginning in 1922, A.C. Gilbert began selling chemistry sets. They were sold with the goal of teaching fundamental chemistry concepts. The range was a continuation of Gilbert Toys' endeavor to provide science-themed educational toys for budding scientists. Gilbert Toys sold millions of Chemistry sets over nearly four decades. The problem with these chemical sets is that they were prone to contain toxic and poisonous chemicals. A brief list of these chemicals is given below but one example is cyanide. Cyanide is a poison that acts quickly; a few hundred milligrams of the material is sufficient to cause death.</p>
             <h1 style="font-size: 25px;"> Chemicals and items that could be found in these chemistry sets: </h1>
            <ul style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;">
                <ol>Borax </ol>
                <ol>calcium chloride</ol>
                <ol>calcium oxide</ol>
                <ol>cobalt chloride</ol>
                <ol>sodium carbonate</ol>
                <ol>copper sulfate (poisonous) </ol>
                <ol>phenolphthalein</ol>
                <ol>ferric ammonium sulphate</ol>
                <ol>sodium ferrocyanide</ol>
                <ol>sulfur</ol>
                <ol>tannic acid</ol>
                <ol>Filter paper</ol>
                <ol>pipette</ol>
                <ol>test tube holder</ol>
                <ol>spoon</ol>
                <ol>red and blue litmus paper</ol>
                <ol>test tubes</ol>

            <h3 style="font-size: 50px;">  THE GILBERT GLASS BOWLING SET </h3>   
            <span> <img src="9859792_1_x.webp" alt="picture of gilbert glass blowing set" style="height: 300px; width:300px; padding: 10px; display: inline; margin-left: 5px;  margin-right: 5px; float: left; "> </span>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;display: inline;">Gilbert supplied sets with blowtorches, glass rods, and instructions for creating laboratory supplies including test tubes and flasks in addition to selling <a href="#gil-chem-kit" style="color:#E86051;">chemistry kits</a> to children, mainly males. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Temperatures of at least several hundred degrees are necessary to make laboratory glass pliable enough to shape it; in fact, these temperatures are more than hot enough to cause third-degree burns. </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Upon its debut in the 1920s, the Gilbert Glass Blowing kit taught children how to bend glass rods at temperatures higher than 1000 degrees in order to create bubbles. Like all of Gilbert's science kits, the glassblowing set taught children science concepts while letting them try dangerous experiments on their own. It seems that children were supposed to "play" with molten lead, diluted sulfuric acid, and melted glass. </p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 50px;"> GILBERT RADIOACTIVE ACTIVE ENERGY LAB KIT </h3>   
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Listed in 2006 Radar Magazine as the Atomic Energy Lab as one of "the 10 most dangerous toys of all time.", the Gilbert U 238 Atomic Energy Lab was a toy and educational set that was sold in the 1950s. Priced at $49.50 the set included four samples of ores that contained uranium, a Geiger Mueller radiation counter among other tools. Contained in the set there was a book featuring Dagwood from the Blondie comic strip. The comic book, titled "Learn How Dagwood Splits the Atom " was written in collaboration, with General Leslie Groves, who directed the Manhattan Project.</p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 25px;"> Other items contained in the lab kit: </h2>
             <ul style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 35px;">
              <ol> an electroscope for charge detection </ol> 
              <ol> a little cloud chamber to see any ionizing radiation particles that may shoot out from your ore </ol>
              <ol> a spinthariscope to observe the phosphor light caused by radiation </ol>
              <ol> government-published handbook called "Prospecting for Uranium" to entice young Americans to look for fresh nuclear resources </ol>
              <ol> Sources of low-level radiation: beta-alpha, pure gamma, pure beta </ol>
              <ol> "Nuclear spheres" to create an alpha particle model </ol>
              <ol> Dr. Ralph E. Lapp's 60-page instruction manual, Gilbert Atomic Energy Manual </ol>
              <ol> Three C-sized batteries </ol>
             </ul>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> A piece of the Gilbert catalog assured customers that "All radioactive materials included with the Atomic Energy Lab have been certified as completely safe by Oak-Ridge Laboratories, part of the Atomic Energy Commission."</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The ores were in glass jars and came with a strong warning not to remove them. Left there, they were probably not harmful to human health. Not unless they were taken out, broken up, and swallowed by accident which children were notorious for.</p>
